#Assignment 9 - README

This README file discusses and answers some of the questions that were asked in the assignment. Everything in this assignment is fully fuctional and even bonus part is implemented as well. 

For the last question of what I would do differently, I WOULD NOT USE BST... Jokes aside, had some problems with implementing certain things, however due to lack of time, I cannot improve or update the code.
